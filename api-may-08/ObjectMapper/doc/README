SUMMARY
--------------

CBIL/ObjectMapper

This is a generic package for translating between object spaces. It follows 
a simple declarative rule structure, in which a set of inputs are mapped 
to a set of outputs. The main classes are RuleSet, which defines the 
structure of the rules and the RuleSetEngine, which actually applies the
rules on the inputs to produce the outputs.

The rules are serialized as XML.

DEPENDENCIES
-----------------

1) The GUS system (www.gusdb.org)

The build and installation of the ObjectMapper package is dependent on the 
GUS build/install framework (see http://www.gusdb.org) but it does not 
depend on any other part of GUS. It is on the TODO list  to make a separate 
install procedure for this package, but currently there is not. 

2) CPAN.org modules

ObjectMapper relies on the following CPAN modules to be installed:

  Tie::IxHash
  XML::Simple


USAGE
-------------

The Perl packages my be used as any other Perl module can. See the 
MR_T project (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/downloads/RAD ) for example binaries
and subclassing.
