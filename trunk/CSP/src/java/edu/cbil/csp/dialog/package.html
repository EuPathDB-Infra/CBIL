<A NAME = "overview"><b>OVERVIEW</b></A><BR><BR>

Also based on Perl CSP, this package builds on top of {@link cbil.csp}
to provide a set of classes with which a programmer can describe an
abstract form or user dialog.  In practical terms, it is currently a
mechanism that can be used to build HTML forms and perform input
validation on the data a user enters into those forms.  However, the
intent of the package is to provide an HTML-independent way of
specifying the user input required by an application.  The idea is
that these classes will allow a programmer to give a declarative
specification of what data is required, leaving the job of generating
either a terminal session, an HTML form, a Javascript-enhanced form, a
Java dialog, etc. up to the discretion of the underlying machinery.
However, as we have already said, the only target language currently
implemented is HTML (4.0).  And, as an unfortunate consequence, the
classes in this package do have some HTML-specific biases.<p>

The central class in this package is {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Dialog};
it represents an abstract "information-gathering session" (current
translation: a single HTML form.)  A {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Dialog}
can contain things.  These things are instances of {@link
cbil.csp.dialog.Item}.  These things can be grouped into logical
{@link cbil.csp.dialog.ItemGroup}s.  In fact, {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Dialog} 
is itself an {@link cbil.csp.dialog.ItemGroup}.  A {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Param}
is a particular kind of {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Item}: one that represents a
single piece of information that the user must enter.  A number of subclasses
of {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Param} define the different types of data that
can be entered and establish the ways in which parameter values can be
restricted (e.g. "only integers between 5 and 12, inclusive.")  Finally, 
{@link cbil.csp.dialog.Action} is another subclass of {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Item},
representing an action that a user is allowed to perform (in HTML actions
are represented by buttons that either submit or reset the form.)<p>

So, to recap: {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Dialog} <b>is-an</b> 
{@link cbil.csp.dialog.ItemGroup}, which in turn <b>is-an</b> 
{@link cbil.csp.dialog.Item}.  A {@link cbil.csp.dialog.ItemGroup}
<b>has-a</b> bunch of {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Item}s.  
{@link cbil.csp.dialog.Param} and {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Action} are two
special subclasses of {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Item}.  That's basically
all there is to it, with the exception that each {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Item}
can also have some help information associated with it.  In the current
implementation, this help information is displayed in a separate part of
the HTML page from the form, with links back and forth between the two.  This 
layout was lifted right out of Perl CSP, as were Jonathan Schug's nifty icons:

<P>
Also, don't worry about the {@link cbil.csp.StringTemplate} arguments that
all of these classes' constructors accept; they're used to alter the default
HTML rendering (done using {@link cbil.csp}, of course) and you're better
off leaving them alone unless you know what you're doing or have some time
to burn.  If you're having trouble with the latter, you might consider opening 
a profitable envelope-stuffing business from the comfort of your own home.  
Just a thought.<p>

Here's the source code to an example program, 
{@link cbil.csp.dialog.Test cbil.csp.dialog.Test}.  
To run it or compile it for yourself you'll need to include the file 
<code>/usr/local/lib/java_classes/JCSP.jar</code> in your Java
<code>CLASSPATH</code>.

	// Create a new Dialog.  The first argument is a string describing

	// the name of the item.  Most if not all subclasses of 
	// {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Item} require a name as their first parameter.
	// This name is used for a couple of important things: first, it is used
	// as the value of the HTML NAME attribute for those items that become
	// input elements in a form.  Second, it is used as a unique identifier
	// with which the {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Item} can be retrieved from its 
	// containing  {@link cbil.csp.dialog.ItemGroup}.  The second parameter
	// is a description of the item group that will appear on the HTML form
	// generated.  The third parameter is a help string that will be displayed
	// in the separate help section.  The last two parameters are 
	// {@link cbil.csp.StringTemplate}s that can be used to customize the
	// HTML generated by the item group.

	// Create and add two parameters to the item group.  Remember that each 
	// instance of {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Param} represents some piece of
	// data you'd like the user to enter.

	// {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Param} is not only the superclass of all 
	// parameters, but it can be used on its own to request an unconstrained
	// string from the user, as we're doing here.
	//
	// The first argument is again the name of the item, and also the key 
	// we'll need to retrieve the information from the form after the user
	// submits it.  The second argument is a description of the item that
	// will appear in the help section.  The third argument is the help 
	// string again, and the next two are {@link cbil.csp.StringTemplate}s.
	// The next argument is a new one, the prompt that will be displayed
	// to the user in the form.  Finally, the last argument is an optional
	// array of "sample values" that will appear in the help section.

                              false));

	// {@link cbil.csp.dialog.IntParam} expects the user to enter an integer
	// value.  The first six arguments (up to and including the "prompt") are 
	// the same as for {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Param}.  The rest are described
	// below:
	//

                                 "Age", 
				 "Enter your age (in human years, wise guy.)",

			       "Submit data"));     // button label

	// Call the method that turns the dialog into HTML.  The argument
	// gives the URL at which the help information will be located, in
	// order that links can be created.  If the help information will
	// be on the same page as the form, this argument should be the
	// empty string, as in this case.
        //
	System.out.println(dialog.makeHTML(""));

	// The separate call required to generate the dialog's help section.
	// This one takes the URL of the page where the form is located,

<A NAME = "issues"><b>KNOWN ISSUES</b></A><BR><BR>

<OL>
<LI>The classes in this package have some HTML-specific parameters (primarily URLs, but
also the "submit" or "reset" parameter expected by {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Action})
that should be factored out in a future version.</LI>
<LI>The user is currently responsible for ensuring that his/her {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Dialog} 
will submit its form data to a back-end program that knows how to invoke the 
<code>Dialog</code>'s input validation routines and that will display an error page
if the provided input is invalid.</LI>
<LI>The validated data should be obtained directly from the {@link cbil.csp.dialog.Param}
objects, but currently the user is responsible for parsing it out of the servlet 
request object.</LI>
<LI>Only a limited number of parameter types are supported.  Please send requests
for those that are missing and needed.</LI>
<LI>Most or all of the parameters have only a single constructor, with lots of arguments,
some of which are optional.  More constructors should be added to make it easier to
create dialogs.</LI>
<LI>Parameters currently don't distinguish between initial values and default values;
only the former are supported.</LI>
